# calculadorajs
This application is about a calculator with the basics functions like '+', '-', '*' and '/'.

I'm use this repository for study reactjs and tranning English with comments on code and writing commit's messages, so if you see erros don't worry, the bigest proposed of this is learn and learn.

Thanks!
